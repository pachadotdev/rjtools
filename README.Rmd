# rjtools

<!-- badges: start -->
[![R-CMD-check](https://github.com/rjournal/rjtools/workflows/R-CMD-check/badge.svg)](https://github.com/rjournal/rjtools/actions)
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of rjtools is to make it easier for AUTHORS of R Journal articles to 

1. create a new paper from a template that will produce both html and pdf versions in the format needed by the journal, and 
2. to run various checks on their paper, that it satisfies various requirements, in preparation for submitting it to the journal.

## Installation

<!-- You can install the released version of rjtools from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with: -->

<!-- ``` r -->
<!-- install.packages("rjtools") -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- And the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/rjournal/rjtools) with: -->

You can install the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/rjournal/rjtools) with: 

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("rjournal/rjtools")
```

## Getting started with a new article

To create an article template under the project directory:

```{r eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
library(rjtools)
create_article(name = "quokka-bilby")
```

To examine how the papers in this format would look in an R Journal issue, take a look at the June 2021 issue  https://journal.r-project.org/issues/2021-1/. Particularly articles by Wang, and two articles by Kane, and the editorial. 

* To learn more on the article creation, read [Create an R Journal Article](https://rjournal.github.io/rjtools/articles/create_article.html).

* For more information on the R Journal format, specifically how to create figures, tables, among others with the new format, read [More details on the R Journal format](https://rjournal.github.io/rjtools/articles/format-details.html).

* The rendered template article is showcased in [The Article Template](https://rjournal.github.io/rjtools/articles/article_template.html).


## Checking that your paper satisfies various conditions

Explore the various `check_XXX` functions that will check the format of your article, and some submission requirements. 

* See [Check your Article Before Submission
](https://rjournal.github.io/rjtools/articles/check_functions.html) for more on this.

## Current problem with `pandoc` (FIXED with `rjtools` version 1.0.18)

Please render the article using these lines:

```
pandoc::pandoc_activate(version = '3.1.6')
rmarkdown::render("quokka-bilby.Rmd", output_format = "all")
```

in your R Console. Also make sure the output in the `yaml` is set as:

```
output: 
  rjtools::rjournal_pdf_article:
    toc: no
  rjtools::rjournal_web_article:
    self_contained: yes
    toc: no
```
